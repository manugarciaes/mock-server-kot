# Mockos
```Mock Server using Kotlin```

Sometimes, in our projects on localhost/dev environments, we have calls to external services like Stripe (for a credit card payment), Paypal, mail services, etc...Â 

It is a problem if we have an end-to-end test (for example using Cypress) where we want to test all the processes with an order after doing a payment but you don't mind the payment system. if we use those external endpoints directly (even using their dev env) it could be for us in our local env a problem if we want to automatize these tests, even, if we use some CI like CircleCI our building time will be incremented because of the external calls.
